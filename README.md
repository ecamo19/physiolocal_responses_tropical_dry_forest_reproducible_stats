For reproducing the results in the repository, two options have been implemented: 

You can report any issue with the repository to erickcamo19@gmail.com

Or visit the github repository at github.com/ecamo19/https://github.com/ecamo19/physiolocal_responses_tropical_dry_forest_reproducible_stats)



## 1) Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ecamo19/physiolocal_responses_tropical_dry_forest_reproducible_stats/HEAD)

To run the binder enviroment visit the webside: 

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ecamo19/physiolocal_responses_tropical_dry_forest_reproducible_stats/HEAD. 

The link will take you to a binder repository where the code can be run. 

The image takes approximately __10-20 minutes to build__.

Inside the repository, go to the folder called notebooks. There you will find 
_.html_ and  _.ipynb_ files. Both contain the same code, their only difference 
is that the _.ipynb_ files can be used to execute and modify the code. 

__Press `crtl + enter` to run each cell (chunk) inside the .ipynb notebooks.__

## 2) Pixi dev
