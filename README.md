This repository contains all the data and code for reproducing the results from the paper titled "Physiological and growth responses of tropical dry forest tree seedlings to water and nutrient additions".

To reproduce the result click on the binder bottom. This will take you to a binder repository where the code can be run. The image takes approximately __10-20 minutes to build__.

Inside the repository, go to the folder called notebooks. There you will find four .html files and four .ipynb files. Both contain the same code, their only difference is that the .ipynb files can be used to execute and modify the code. Press `crtl + enter` to run the code.
